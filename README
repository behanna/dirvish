These files are not yet tested or executable.  They will be someday,
but they will need more work.  Most importantly, I want to fix these
things:

1)  There is a ChmodOnExpire fix described on the Wiki.  It makes use
    of the "X" flag for GNU chmod.  The dirvish backup system will be
    used on Macs and BSD and Solaris and ... .  I do not want to use
    any features that are not on all these machines (and testable as
    well).

    I would like to see this whole section reworked;  I do not like
    using system calls when there is a Perl equivalent.  Please look
    through CPAN for appropriate modules that do the same thing.  
    That is more efficient, and more portable, and more readable.

2)  The install has been changed to Module::Build.  I refactored the
    contents of loadconfig.pl into the library dirvishlib.pl, and
    sucked in all other subroutines as well.  These will live by
    default in /usr/share/dirvish .

    Eventually, the install should also do testing.

3)  I want a heck of a lot more documentation on how this thing works.


Notes:

I have refactored all the subroutines into dirvishlib.pl .  We may
want to make a package out of this instead.   I added a few subs
to get rid of the anonymous subs in options, and a routine that
incorporates the common code for loading the master.conf file, and
another routine that initializes the %$Options hash.   I am not yet
initializing *everything* in the hash, but I think that might be a
good move, depending on what we learn while building test harnesses.

I combined the imsort subroutines from both dirvish-expire and
dirvish-locate.  This may not be kosher.
