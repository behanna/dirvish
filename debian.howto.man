.IX Header "dirvish for Debian"
Here's a simple step-by-step example of how to use \fBdirvish\fR to make a
backup of your root partition on a second disk which is mounted as
/backup :
.PP
First, note that the example files listed below can be found in
\&\f(CW\*(C`/usr/share/doc/dirvish/examples/\*(C'\fR as \f(CW\*(C`dirvish.conf\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`dirvish.conf.root\*(C'\fR . Don't forget to modify the client line! (see below)
.PP
In \f(CW\*(C`/etc/dirvish/master.conf\*(C'\fR put the following:
.PP
.Vb 16
\& bank:
\&        /backup
\& exclude:
\&        lost+found/
\&        *~
\&        .nfs*
\& Runall:
\&        root    22:00
\& expire-default: +15 days
\& expire-rule:
\& #       MIN HR    DOM MON       DOW  STRFTIME_FMT
\&        *   *     *   *         1    +3 months
\&        *   *     1-7 *         1    +1 year
\&        *   *     1-7 1,4,7,10  1
\&        *   10-20 *   *         *    +4 days
\& #      *   *     *   *         2-7  +15 days
.Ve
.PP
Lines beginning with \*(L"#\*(R" are comments. The \*(L"bank\*(R" (the safety deposit
kind) defines where the data to be stored; in this example it's at
\&\f(CW\*(C`/backup\*(C'\fR. The exclude stanza is a default list of filenames that are
not to be backed up.
.PP
The \fBRunall\fR stanza tells which \*(L"vaults\*(R" (area of storage inside the
bank) to backup during the daily run. Note that each vault contains at
least one branch; for simple usage you can basically ignore branches
and then the \*(L"default\*(R" branch will be used for a vault.
.PP
The time next to the vault name defines the timestamp of the backup; it
is forced to be in the past. This means that if the time stated is
22:00, and the backup is made at 01:00, then the backup will have the
date of the previous day, which keeps the names of the backups
consistent, even if the backup was delayed for some reason. Also,
people expect backups to contain the state of things at the end of the
date shown, so setting the time to the end of the day will keep the
date as expected, even if for some reason the backup is made after
00:00.
.PP
In short: make sure that the time listed is earlier than when the
backup will be made, preferably before midnight, and everything will be
\&\s-1OK\s0.
.PP
The \fBexpire-default\fR line defines the default age after which backups
will expire, i.e. be removed by \fBdirvish-expire\fR.
.PP
The \fBexpire-rule\fR stanza is for refining how long before a backup
expires; e.g. the first line has \*(L"1\*(R" for \s-1DOW\s0 (day of week), i.e.
Monday. Hence backups made on a Monday will stay around for 3 months.
The second line says that backups made in the first week of the month
(\s-1DOM\s0 = day of month) won't expire until after one year. An empty time
spec is the same as \*(L"never\*(R".
.PP
After having defined the master configuration above, a
configuration for each branch needs to be defined. Remember that each
vault contains at least one branch, and in our simple example this is
simply the \*(L"default\*(R" branch. The configuration file for the default
branch is \fI$BANK\fR/\fI$VAULT\fR\fB/dirvish/default.conf\fR, where \fI$BANK\fR is
the definition of the bank from the master config, and \fI$VAULT\fR is the
name of the vault (\*(L"root\*(R" in our example). So, in
\&\f(CW\*(C`/backup/root/dirvish/default.conf\*(C'\fR put the following:
.PP
.Vb 10
\& client: thishost
\& tree: /
\& xdev: true
\& index: gzip
\& image-default: %Y%m%d
\& exclude:
\&        var/cache/apt/archives
\&        var/cache/man
\&        tmp
\&        var/tmp
.Ve
.PP
The \fBclient\fR line defines which system the data is to come from. If
this is to be a local backup i.e. the backup is made on the same
system, put the output from the \fBhostname\fR command here. \fBdirvish\fR
will then know that the network is not to be used.
.PP
The \fBtree\fR line defines which directory tree is to be backed up for
this vault definition.
.PP
The \fBxdev\fR line tells \fBdirvish\fR to stay on the same filesystem as the
one where the tree starts, i.e. to only backup that one filesystem.
This is a must when the backup is made to a filesystem mounted on the
same tree! Otherwise e.g. \f(CW\*(C`/backup\*(C'\fR would also be backed up, which
won't work of course. If the backup is on the same filesystem, exclude
patterns will have to be used. Also ensure that \f(CW\*(C`/proc\*(C'\fR isn't looked
at by \fBdirvish\fR, as access to \*(L"files\*(R" there can crash your system!
Other \*(L"special\*(R" filesystems such as devfs, sysfs and \s-1NFS\s0 mounts must
also be excluded (all of which the \fBxdev\fR option conveniently does for
you; i.e. it's best to always backup per filesystem).
.PP
The \fBimage-default\fR line defines the default name of each image; the
setting above uses the year, month, and day of month. The exclude
stanza defines what files to exclude from this vault's backup, in
addition to those excludes specified in the master.conf file.
.PP
The \fBindex\fR line specifies that an index file of the image is to be
created and stored compressed with gzip.
.PP
The definition is now complete. To initialize the first image,
run the following command:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& dirvish --vault root --init
.Ve
.PP
This will now create an initial backup image for root.
.PP
From now on, the daily run of \fBdirvish-runall\fR will backup
those vaults that are defined in the master config in the \fBRunall\fR
stanza.
.PP
The daily run of \fBdirvish-expire\fR will examine the \f(CW\*(C`summary\*(C'\fR
file (in the image subdirectories inside the vaults) to determine which
images to remove. The time of expiry is actually determined when the
image is created. For this, the expire rules in the master config and
in the vault-specific (actually branch\-specific, remember?) config if
rules exist in that config, which overrule the master config, are used.
.PP
Note that \fBdirvish-expire\fR will never remove the last good image in a
branch. The best time to run \fBdirvish-expire\fR is just before
\&\fBdirvish-runall\fR, so that the expired images will be deleted just
before the new one is created, thus making space available for the new
image. This is what the Debian dirvish-cronjob script does (see next
point).
.PP
In no circumstances should \fBdirvish-expire\fR and \fBdirvish-runall\fR run
simultaneously (as both of these can heavily impact system performance,
and running together may lead to problems); running either of these
together with \fBupdatedb\fR (for the \fBlocate\fR command) should also be
avoided. Speaking of \fBupdatedb\fR: it's probably best to exclude the
dirvish banks from the updatedb scan! Using a separate filesystem for
the bank, and only mounting that when necessary, precludes the need to
update \f(CW\*(C`/etc/updatedb.conf\*(C'\fR.
.PP
The Debian installation includes a cron configuration that runs
\&\fBdirvish-expire\fR and \fBdirvish-runall\fR every night at 23:04. You can
modify the cron entry itself in \f(CW\*(C`/etc/cron.d/dirvish\*(C'\fR and the script
that is run is \f(CW\*(C`/etc/dirvish/dirvish\-cronjob\*(C'\fR which can also be
modified if necessary (e.g. to mount and umount \f(CW\*(C`/backup\*(C'\fR).
.PP
If running \fBdirvish\fR over the network is intended, you may
want to investigate setting up \fBssh\fR so that \fBrsync\fR will run over
\&\fBssh\fR without passwords or passphrases being asked. This is basically
an ssh \s-1FAQ\s0... search for \f(CW\*(C`authorized_keys\*(C'\fR and/or \f(CW\*(C`ssh\-agent\*(C'\fR.
.PP
For more information, see the \s-1HOWTO\s0 file and \s-1FAQ\s0.html in
\&\f(CW\*(C`/usr/share/doc/dirvish/\*(C'\fR , and the \fBdirvish\fR and \fBdirvish.conf\fR
manpages.
